  :a: Alan Kay

- :c: Debugging is anticipated with distaste, performed with reluctance, and bragged about forever.
  :a: Dan Kaminsky

- :c: Memory is like an orgasm. It's a lot better if you don't have to fake it.
  :a: Seymour Cray on virtual memory

- :c: The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'
  :a: Isaac Asimov

- :c: The difference between theory and practice is smaller in theory than in practice.

- :c: "There are only 3 numbers of interest to a computer scientist: 1, 0 and infinity."

- :c: Debuggers don't remove bugs. They only show them in slow motion.

- :c: Never trust a programmer in a suit.

- :c: In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they're not.

- :c: Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.
  :a: Alan Kay

- :c: The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it's too late."
  :a: Seymour Cray

- :c: Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
  :a: Bill Gates

- :c: It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC. As potential programmers, they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.
  :a: E. W. Dijkstra

- :c: With regard to adding more programmers to get a project done faster - Nine people can't make a baby in a month.
  :a: Fred Brooks

- :c: "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult."
  :a: C.A.R. Hoare.

- :c: Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.

    A programmer started to cuss
    Because getting to sleep was a fuss
    As he lay there in bed
    Looping 'round in his head
    was: while(!asleep()) sheep++;

- :c: Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.
  :a: Donald Knuth
  
- :c: "C++: an octopus made by nailing extra legs onto a dog."

- :c: An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.
  :a: Niels Bohr

- :c: "Theory is when you know something, but it doesn't work. Practice is when something works, but you don't know why. Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don't know why."

- :c: You can stand on the shoulders of giants OR a big enough pile of dwarfs, works either way.

- :c: XML is like violence - if it's not working for you, you're not using enough of it.

- :c: Whereas Europeans generally pronounce my name the right way ('Nick-louse Veert'), Americans invariably mangle it into 'Nickel's Worth.' This is to say that Europeans call me by name, but Americans call me by value.
  :a: Niklaus Wirth

- :c: Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
  :a: Martin Fowler

- :c: There are 10 types of people in the world, those who can read binary, and those who can't.

- :c: Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
  :a: From SICP

- :c: Every language has an optimization operator. In C++ that operator is ‘//’

- :c: Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
  :a: Rich Cook

- :c: An idiot with a computer is a faster, better idiot.
  :a: Rich Julius

- :c: Brevity is the soul of wit.
  :a: Shakespeare

- :c: The question of whether computers can think is just like the question of whether submarines can swim.
  :a: Edsger W. Dijkstra

- :c: There's no test like production.

- :c: We better hurry up and start coding, there are going to be a lot of bugs to fix.

- :c: Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren't doing anything. One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them. Very often they're sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space. What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.
  :a: Charles M Strauss

- :c: The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from not-working to working.
  :a: John Ousterhout

- :c: Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.

- :c: To iterate is human, to recurse divine.
  :a: L. Peter Deutsch

- :c: "C++ : Where friends have access to your private members."
  :a: Gavin Russell Baker

- :c: A computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match.
  :a: Bill Bryson

- :c: UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity.
  :a: Dennis Ritchie

- :c: Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.
  :a: Edward V Berard

- :c: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
  :a: Hofstadter's Law

- :c: Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
  :a: Rick Osborne

- :c: Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
  :a: Brian Kernighan

- :c: The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.
  :a: Tom Cargill

- :c: Java is to JavaScript what Car is to Carpet.
  :a: Chris Heilmann
 
- :c: If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on and the dedication to go through with it.
  :a: John Carmack

- :c: The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying.
  :a: John Carmack on software patents

- :c: "Some people, when confronted with a problem, think \"I know, I'll use regular expressions.\" Now they have two problems."
  :a: Jamie Zawinski
  
- :c: "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."

- :c: Linux is only free if your time has no value.
  :a: Jamie Zawinski

- :c: It works on my machine.

- :c: It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.
  :a: Nathaniel S Borenstein

- :c: In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.

- :c: On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.
  :a: Charles Babbage

- :c: If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
  :a: Edsger Dijkstra

- :c: PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals.
  :a: Jon Ribbens

- :c: Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
  :a: Antoine de Saint Exupéry

- :c: Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
  :a: E. W. Dijkstra

- :c: Better train people and risk they leave – than do nothing and risk they stay.

  :a: Robert R. Coveyou, Oak Ridge National Laboratory

- :c: Anyone who considers arithmetic methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.
  :a: John von Neumann
  
- :c: APL, I believe, can only be learned by writing one-liners–only by seeing in a sense, what you can compress into a line.
  :a: Alan J Perlis

- :c: I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
  :a: Douglas Adams
