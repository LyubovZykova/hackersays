   I Hate Programming.
   I Hate Programming.
   I Hate Programming.
   It works!
   I Love Programming.

- :c: Perl - The only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption.
  :a: Keith Bostic

- :c: I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.
  :a: Alan Kay

- :c: Debugging is anticipated with distaste, performed with reluctance, and bragged about forever.
  :a: Dan Kaminsky

- :c: Memory is like an orgasm. It's a lot better if you don't have to fake it.
  :a: Seymour Cray on virtual memory

- :c: The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'
  :a: Isaac Asimov

- :c: A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any other invention in human history, with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila.
  :a: Mitch Ratcliffe

- :c: Engineers are all basically high-functioning autistics who have no idea how normal people do stuff.
  :a: Cory Doctorow

- :c: Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from a rigged demonstration.

- :c: Vi is a subset of evil.

- :c: The difference between theory and practice is smaller in theory than in practice.

- :c: "There are only 3 numbers of interest to a computer scientist: 1, 0 and infinity."

- :c: Debuggers don't remove bugs. They only show them in slow motion.

- :c: Never trust a programmer in a suit.

- :c: In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they're not.

- :c: Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.
  :a: Alan Kay

- :c: The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it's too late."
  :a: Seymour Cray

- :c: Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
  :a: Bill Gates

- :c: It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC. As potential programmers, they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.
  :a: E. W. Dijkstra

- :c: With regard to adding more programmers to get a project done faster - Nine people can't make a baby in a month.
  :a: Fred Brooks

- :c: "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult."
  :a: C.A.R. Hoare.

- :c: Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.

    "A programmer started to cuss
    Because getting to sleep was a fuss
    As he lay there in bed
    Looping 'round in his head
    was: while(!asleep()) sheep++;"

- :c: Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.
  :a: Donald Knuth
  
- :c: "C++: an octopus made by nailing extra legs onto a dog."
  :a: Steve Taylor

- :c: If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution.
  :a: Robert Sewell

- :c: My definition of an expert in any field is a person who knows enough about what's really going on to be scared.
  :a: P. J. Plauger

- :c: An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.
  :a: Niels Bohr

- :c: "Theory is when you know something, but it doesn't work. Practice is when something works, but you don't know why. Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don't know why."

- :c: You can stand on the shoulders of giants OR a big enough pile of dwarfs, works either way.

- :c: XML is like violence - if it's not working for you, you're not using enough of it.

- :c: Whereas Europeans generally pronounce my name the right way ('Nick-louse Veert'), Americans invariably mangle it into 'Nickel's Worth.' This is to say that Europeans call me by name, but Americans call me by value.
  :a: Niklaus Wirth

- :c: Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
  :a: Martin Fowler

- :c: There are 10 types of people in the world, those who can read binary, and those who can't.

- :c: Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
  :a: From SICP

- :c: Every language has an optimization operator. In C++ that operator is ‘//’

- :c: Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
  :a: Rich Cook

- :c: An idiot with a computer is a faster, better idiot.
  :a: Rich Julius

- :c: Brevity is the soul of wit.
  :a: Shakespeare

- :c: The question of whether computers can think is just like the question of whether submarines can swim.
  :a: Edsger W. Dijkstra

- :c: There's no test like production.
